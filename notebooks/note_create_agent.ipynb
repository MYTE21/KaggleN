      "\n",
      "### Understand the Competition\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Problem Type:** The competition involves solving olympiad-level math problems written in LaTeX format. These problems cover algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory, ranging from National Olympiad to IMO (International Mathematical Olympiad) standards.\n",
      "*   **AI-Hard Problems:** The problems are specifically designed to be \"AI-hard,\" meaning they are challenging for current AI models.\n",
      "*   **Submission Format:** This is a Code Competition. You'll need to use a provided Python evaluation API to submit your solutions, which will handle test set questions one by one in a random order.\n",
      "*   **Answers:** Answers are non-negative integers between 0 and 99999. Modulo calculations are explicitly stated if required.\n",
      "*   **Test Sets:** There's a public test set of 50 problems and a private test set of another 50 problems.\n",
      "*   **Prizes:** The competition has a substantial prize pool, including an \"Overall Progress Prize\" for achieving a high score on both test sets, a \"Longest Leader Prize,\" \"Math Corpus Prize\" (for creating valuable datasets), \"Hard Problem Prize,\" and \"Writeup Prize.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Areas of Preparation\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Mathematical Foundations:**\n",
      "    *   **Core Math Concepts:** Refresh your knowledge of algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. Focus on topics typically found in national and international math olympiads.\n",
      "    *   **Problem-Solving Strategies:** Familiarize yourself with common mathematical problem-solving techniques and proof methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **AI and Machine Learning Skills:**\n",
      "    *   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Since this competition involves AI solving math problems, understanding LLMs is crucial. Explore their capabilities, limitations, and fine-tuning techniques.\n",
      "    *   **Code-Based Reasoning:** The competition allows for solutions that involve generating and executing Python code. Familiarize yourself with how to prompt LLMs to produce code for solving mathematical problems.\n",
      "    *   **Model Architectures:** Research models that have performed well in similar AI math competitions. The competition builds upon previous AIMO Progress Prize events.\n",
      "    *   **Fine-tuning and Training:** Leverage the provided compute resources (H100 GPUs) to train and fine-tune your models.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Technical Skills:**\n",
      "    *   **Python Proficiency:** Strong Python skills are essential for implementing your models and interacting with the Kaggle API.\n",
      "    *   **LaTeX:** Understand how to parse and process mathematical notation written in LaTeX.\n",
      "    *   **Data Handling:** Learn how to manage and process the competition data, which consists of LaTeX problem statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Kaggle Platform Familiarization:**\n",
      "    *   **Submission API:** Study the provided Python evaluation API and the example submission notebook.\n",
      "    *   **Notebooks:** Review the starter notebooks provided on Kaggle, which offer instructions on setting up environments and running models.\n",
      "    *   **Discussion Forums:** Engage with the community on Kaggle's discussion forums. This is a great place to ask questions, share insights, and find collaborators.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Strategy and Best Practices:**\n",
      "    *   **Open Source:** The competition emphasizes open-source contributions. Make sure your code, data, and methods are publicly available if you aim for prizes.\n",
      "    *   **Robustness:** Consider strategies to improve the robustness of your model's answers, such as early stopping and answer aggregation from multiple generations.\n",
      "    *   **Resource Management:** With significant compute resources available, plan how to best utilize them for training and inference.\n",
      "    *   **Dataset Creation:** If you aim for the Math Corpus Prize, focus on creating a high-quality, publicly available dataset.\n",
      "    *   **Write-ups:** If you're not a top-performing team, consider writing a detailed solution write-up for the Writeup Prize.\n",
      "\n",
      "By focusing on these areas, you can build a strong foundation to tackle the challenges presented in the AI Mathematical Olympiad - Progress Prize 3.\n"

These problems cover algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory, ranging from National Olympiad to IMO (International Mathematical Olympiad) standards.\n*   **AI-Hard Problems:** The problems are specifically designed to be \"AI-hard,\" meaning they are challenging for current AI models.\n*   **Submission Format:** This is a Code Competition. You'll need to use a provided Python evaluation API to submit your solutions, which will handle test set questions one by one in a random order.\n*   **Answers:** Answers are non-negative integers between 0 and 99999. Modulo calculations are explicitly stated if required.\n*   **Test Sets:** There's a public test set of 50 problems and a private test set of another 50 problems.\n*   **Prizes:** The competition has a substantial prize pool, including an \"Overall Progress Prize\" for achieving a high score on both test sets, a \"Longest Leader Prize,\" \"Math Corpus Prize\" (for creating valuable datasets), \"Hard Problem Prize,\" and \"Writeup Prize.\"\n\n### Key Areas of Preparation\n\n1.  **Mathematical Foundations:**\n    *   **Core Math Concepts:** Refresh your knowledge of algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. Focus on topics typically found in national and international math olympiads.\n    *   **Problem-Solving Strategies:** Familiarize yourself with common mathematical problem-solving techniques and proof methods.\n\n2.  **AI and Machine Learning Skills:**\n    *   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Since this competition involves AI solving math problems, understanding LLMs is crucial. Explore their capabilities, limitations, and fine-tuning techniques.\n    *   **Code-Based Reasoning:** The competition allows for solutions that involve generating and executing Python code. Familiarize yourself with how to prompt LLMs to produce code for solving mathematical problems.\n    *   **Model Architectures:** Research models that have performed well in similar AI math competitions. The competition builds upon previous AIMO Progress Prize events.\n    *   **Fine-tuning and Training:** Leverage the provided compute resources (H100 GPUs) to train and fine-tune your models.\n\n3.  **Technical Skills:**\n    *   **Python Proficiency:** Strong Python skills are essential for implementing your models and interacting with the Kaggle API.\n    *   **LaTeX:** Understand how to parse and process mathematical notation written in LaTeX.\n    *   **Data Handling:** Learn how to manage and process the competition data, which consists of LaTeX problem statements.\n\n4.  **Kaggle Platform Familiarization:**\n    *   **Submission API:** Study the provided Python evaluation API and the example submission notebook.\n    *   **Notebooks:** Review the starter notebooks provided on Kaggle, which offer instructions on setting up environments and running models.\n    *   **Discussion Forums:** Engage with the community on Kaggle's discussion forums. This is a great place to ask questions, share insights, and find collaborators.\n\n5.  **Strategy and Best Practices:**\n    *   **Open Source:** The competition emphasizes open-source contributions. Make sure your code, data, and methods are publicly available if you aim for prizes.\n    *   **Robustness:** Consider strategies to improve the robustness of your model's answers, such as early stopping and answer aggregation from multiple generations.\n    *   **Resource Management:** With significant compute resources available, plan how to best utilize them for training and inference.\n    *   **Dataset Creation:** If you aim for the Math Corpus Prize, focus on creating a high-quality, publicly available dataset.\n    *   **Write-ups:** If you're not a top-performing team, consider writing a detailed solution write-up for the Writeup Prize.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can build a strong foundation to tackle the challenges presented in the AI Mathematical Olympiad - Progress Prize 3."
